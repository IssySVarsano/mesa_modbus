Using USB/serial

echo -en '\x01\x05\x00\x00\x5A\x00\xF7\x6A' > /dev/ttyUSB0

USB-serial Green to 16 RX+
           White to 17 RX-

3FC0 = no data 3FE1 = 1 frame 3FE2 = 2 frames

Relay board:
1) You can poll the state of all relays with 01 01 00 00 00 08 3D CC as documented
But, oddly, it has to be 08 rather than the actual number of channels. 04 gets no response.
2) You can read the inputs with 01 02 00 00 00 08 79 CC
But, oddly, they seem to be reversed relative to the silkscreen. bit 0 is input 3, bit 1 is input 2, etc. Again, it needs to be a read of 8, not the actual number of channels.
3) Modbus command 15 does not seem to be supported.

Relayboard - A+ -> Rx-/Tx- B- -> Rx+/Tx+

ADC board ?
